## 5. Configure Options: Set custom log file paths and container names according to your environment setup:

#### This functionality will be useful for those with log files stored in a folder other than the default, so you can change it to suit your needs. Also, for your convenience, if you don't want to change the path or container name, press `Enter` to keep the —Åurrent value.

#### For example, your log files are found in the `/var/log/Amasty/` folder, you can easily view them using this option:

## 6. Possibility to execute `bin/log` with arguments

Using `bin/log --tail cron.log system.log` OR `bin/log -t system.log cron.log` to shorten, you can monitor logs in real-time for two or more log files.

Also, if your log files are found in the `/var/log/Amasty/` folder using `bin/log -t Amasty/some.log Amasty/some2.log` OR `bin/log --tail Amasty/some.log Amasty/some2.log` you can easily view them:
