#### This functionality will be useful for those with log files stored in a folder other than the default, so you can change it to suit your needs. Also, for your convenience, if you don't want to change the path or container name, press `Enter` to keep the current value.

## 6. Possibility to execute `bin/log` with arguments

For example, use `bin/log --tail cron.log system.log` OR `bin/log -t system.log cron.log` to shorten, you can monitor logs in real-time for two or more log files.

To avoid mixing, I did it as follows:

First, the logs from the first file are displayed, then after `Ctrl + C` you can see the real-time logs from the other file(s).
